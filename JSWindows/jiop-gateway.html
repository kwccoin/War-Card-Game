<h1> <i>JavaScript Object Programming (JOP)</i><br>Gateway Page</h1>

<h2><i>JOP</i> Gateway</h2>

<p>Choices are also on the menu, above.</p>

<ul>

	<li>The <a href='op-code.html'>Coding Tutorials</a> provide hands-on work for the reader that wants to master JavaScript programming for class-based inheritance and prototypal inheritance.</li>

	<li>The <i>JSWindows</i> system demonstrates both class-based inheritance and object programming. A major design goal of <i>JSWindows</i> was to be sure no user ever needed documentation for <a href='jswindows/op-doc-user.html'>Using <i>JSWindows</i></a>. These pages are for engineers who need to learn more about the system's UI.</li>

	<li>The <a href='jswindows/op-doc-coder.html'><i>JWindows</i> Examples</a> are for engineer's who want to use the system for their own applications.</li>

	<li>The full <i>JSWindows</i> <a href='jswindows/source/op-source.html'>Source Code</a> is for those who like to know how things work.</li>

</ul>

<p>Notes (below) on this page include yellow reference keys used in the back of the <i>JOP</i> book's "Notes" pages. A reference to "Clss-6" there corresponds to <span class='ref'>Clss-6</span> here. (You might want to look that up if you did not know that class-based OOP was now available even in the Cobol language.)</p>

<p>The following links were verified 11 June, 2013; 28 July, 2013; 11 November, 2015.</p>

<h2>JavaScript People</h2>
<p><strong>Brendan Eich:</strong> JavaScript's first version was designed and written by Brendan Eich. His <a href='https://brendaneich.com/'>personal site</a> tells you more about his current work as CTO of Mozilla (best known for the Firefox browsers, Netscape's successors). Today Eich chairs the ECMA Technical Committee 39 (TC39) that is responsible for the international <a href='http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf'>ECMAScript (aka JavaScript) standards</a>. His <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich'>Wikipedia biography</a> is too short.</p>

<p><strong>Douglas Crockford:</strong> Crockford is well-known for his book, <i>JavaScript: The Good Parts</i>, for his JavaScript quality checker, <a href='http://www.jslint.com/'>JSLint</a>, for finding Eich's object literal notation to be a quality data-sharing vehicle he named <a href='http://www.json.org/'>JSON</a>, for serving on TC39 and being top JavaScripter at Yahoo! and today at PayPal. His <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford'>Wikipedia biography</a> includes a "Criticism" that is more amusing than critical.</p>

<h2>Books re JavaScript, Programming and Object-Oriented Programming</h2>

<p>Conflict of interest: <i>JOP</i> is sold by Amazon (wholesale and retail). Links to Amazon for books in print are, however, common today, even in libraries, as they provide considerable information, well beyond what one might find in a card catalog.</p>

<p><strong>Classics:</strong> In chronological order, classic books referenced in <i>JOP</i> are:<br>

<p><strong>JavaScript</strong>:<br>

<h2>Wikipedia on Object-Oriented Programming, Class-Based Inheritance and Prototypal Inheritance</h2>

<span class='ref'>Oop-W</span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming'>Object-Oriented Programming</a>. The first paragraph is perfect.<br>

<span class='ref'>Prtp-W</span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming'>Prototype-Based Programming</a>. Ironically, an excellent description of class-based programming. A good summary of the argument for prototypes as opposed to classes.<br>

<span class='ref'>Clss-W</span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science)'>Classes</a> (but beware of the first sentence).<br>

<span class='ref'>Inst-W</span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)'>Instances (objects)</a>, very good beginner's introduction, very poor Wikipedia article.<br>

<span class='ref'>Mthd-W</span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_science)'>Methods</a>, another good introduction, but "class" must be defined broadly to not exclude prototypal language methods.<br>

<span class='ref'>Inhr-W</span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)'>Inheritance</a> inadvertently, but correctly, defines "classical" inheritance as OOP inheritance (as opposed to prototypal inheritance). Supports the use of "super," a term to which we object.<br>

<span class='ref'>Cmp-W</span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance'>Composition over inheritance</a>. The idea is the same, but I hope <i>JOP</i> is less confusing.<br>

<span class='ref'>Trts-W</span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traits_(computer_science)'>Traits</a> "Traits" may be close to, or the same as, our "capabilities," but this article is not clear enough for any certainty.</p>

<h2>This Website on Class-Based Inheritance and JavaScript Programming</h2>
<p><a href='http://martinrinehart.com/frontend-engineering/engineers/javascript/inher/masters/master-inheritance-comparison.html'>Master Classers</a>, a comparison of OOP library APIs (plus Crockford, on prototypal, and your author on plain JavaScript).<br>

<a href='http://martinrinehart.com/frontend-engineering/engineers/javascript/inher/javascript-inher-menu.html'>JavaScript Classes</a>, a set of pages, most predating this book, on various class/prototypal topics. Some may be quite obsolete.<br>

<a href='http://martinrinehart.com/frontend-engineering/engineers/javascript/cheryl-rule.html'>Cheryl rule</a> on JavaScript readability.</p>
